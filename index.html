            This is Max. He is a puppy who is only 3 weeks old. This
            young pup is not house trained yet, but he loves to play
            outside and he is very smart. He looks like a Labrador
            Retriever but I'm not sure so we'll never really know.

            This is Bailey. She is a brown dog that has a long nose
            and big ears. If you know what type of dog this is, then
            congrats, you're a nerd. I know you thought I wanted you
            to tell me what type of dog this is, but you got finessed.
            This dog is only 9 months old (most likely).
